# Datopian - Challenge 1

## Task
Write a script to get a nice CSV file of natural gas prices.

The script is named challenge1.py

* Install the requirements.txt in a virtual enviroment.

* Run `python challenge1.py -g d` to get the daily data prices of natural gas.

* The data will be stored in a CSV file inside the `data` folder.

* A `datapackage.json` file will be generatated/updated.

* You can choose different granularity to collect the data (`d` for daily,`w` for weekly,`m` for monthly, or `a` for annual).

* The resulting graphs can be seen [here](https://wkswilliam.github.io/datopian/).
